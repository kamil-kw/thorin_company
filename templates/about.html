    <p>
        The formation of the group grew out of a meeting Gandalf had with Thorin in Bree which kindled Thorin's interest
        in recapturing his long lost family inheritance. (Thorin's grandfather had been the king of the Lonely Mountain
        when Smaug came and took it.) Remembering that he had once known an adventurous Hobbit on his travels in the
        Shire, Gandalf decided to add Bilbo to their company because he knew that stealth and cunning were preferable to
        force. Gandalf also believed that someone like Bilbo could keep the sometimes prideful and stubborn Dwarves from
        rash action. The superstitious Dwarves also considered thirteen to be an unlucky number, and as Gandalf had
        planned to leave on other business, welcomed a fourteenth to fill into their party.

            <h3>Thorin II Oakenshield</h3>
            <p>
                Thorin II was born in TA 2746 to Dwarf prince Thráin II in the city of the Lonely Mountain. Early in his
                youth, he and the other Dwarves of the Lonely Mountain were forced to flee by the dragon Smaug in TA
                2770. While in exile, he quickly grew to become a capable warrior. This was demonstrated when he
                participated in the Battle of Azanulbizar in TA 2799. He fought with one of the Dwarven armies beneath
                the East-gate of Moria. At some point in the fighting, his shield broke, and using an oaken tree branch
                found on the ground as a shield, he gained the epithet "Oakenshield," which would remain with him even
                in death.

            <p>
                Fíli and Kíli were nephews of Thorin, who was the elder brother of their mother Dís. They were also nephews
                of Frerin, grandsons of Thráin II, and great-grandsons of Thrór. Fíli's most distinguishing feature was his
                long nose, the longest of any of the Dwarves in Thorin's company.

            <h3>Óin</h3>
            <p>
                Óin was the older brother of Glóin, cousin of Dwalin and Balin, and uncle of Gimli. Óin's uncle was
                Fundin, the father of Balin and Dwalin. He usually wore a brown-hooded cloak when travelling. Óin fought
                in the Battle of Azanulbizar along with Thorin Oakenshield, and in TA 2941 joined with Thorin and
                Company on the quest to reclaim the Lonely Mountain wearing a brown hood.[2] Óin was one of the Dwarves
                who bet that Bilbo would come along with them to reclaim the Lonely Mountain. Óin and his brother Glóin
                were usually in charge of preparing the fire for the Company as they were the most skilled out of the
                others. He fought in and survived the Battle of Five Armies, and later settled in the Lonely Mountain
                with King Dáin II Ironfoot, along with many other Dwarves of The Company of Thorin.
